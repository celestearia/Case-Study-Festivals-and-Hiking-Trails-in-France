# Case Study: Analysis of Trails and Festivals in Various Regions of France

## Overview

This case study explores the relationship and distribution of trails and festivals across different communes and regions of France. The analysis leverages multiple datasets to provide insights into the cultural and recreational landscape.

## Repository Contents

1. **presentation.Rmd** - An R Markdown file presenting the key findings and visualizations from the analysis.
2. **map_v2.4.Rmd** - An R Markdown file specifically focused on mapping trails and festivals using geospatial techniques.
3. **commune_trails.csv** - A dataset containing information about trails categorized by communes.
4. **region_festivals.csv** - A dataset detailing festivals organized by regions.
5. **region_trails.csv** - A dataset containing information about trails categorized by regions.
6. **top_20_festivals.csv** - A dataset listing the top 20 festivals based on certain criteria.
7. **cleaned_festivals.csv** - A cleaned dataset of festivals used for the analysis.
8. **cleaned_trails.csv** - A cleaned dataset of trails used for the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To replicate the analysis, you will need:

- R and RStudio installed on your machine.
- The following R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `sf`, `leaflet`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/case-study-trails-festivals.git
   cd case-study-trails-festivals
   ```

2. **Install essential R packages:**

   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "sf", "leaflet", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
   ```

## Data Description

- **commune_trails.csv**: Contains columns such as `commune_name`, `trail_id`, `trail_length`, `difficulty`, and `trail_type`.
- **region_festivals.csv**: Includes columns like `region_name`, `festival_id`, `festival_name`, `date`, `attendance`, and `festival_type`.
- **region_trails.csv**: Lists `region_name`, `trail_id`, `trail_length`, `difficulty`, and `trail_type`.
- **top_20_festivals.csv**: Details the top 20 festivals with columns like `festival_id`, `festival_name`, `region`, `attendance`, and `ranking`.
- **cleaned_festivals.csv**: A processed version of the festivals data with similar columns to `region_festivals.csv`.
- **cleaned_trails.csv**: A processed version of the trails data with similar columns to `region_trails.csv`.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Load the raw datasets.
   - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, standardize formats, etc.).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generate summary statistics.
   - Create visualizations to understand the distribution of trails and festivals.

3. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Map the trails and festivals using `leaflet` and `sf` packages.
   - Identify patterns and insights from the spatial distribution.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Compile findings into a presentation (`presentation.Rmd`).
   - Detailed mapping and analysis in `map_v2.4.Rmd`.

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

To run the analysis and generate the reports, open the `.Rmd` files in RStudio and knit them to your desired output format (HTML, PDF, etc.).

### Example

```R
rmarkdown::render("presentation.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("map_v2.4.Rmd")
```

## Results

The key results and insights from the analysis are documented in the `presentation.Rmd` file, including:

- Distribution and characteristics of trails across communes and regions.
- Insights into the popularity and types of festivals.
- Geospatial visualizations showing the locations and density of trails and festivals.

## Conclusion

This case study provides a comprehensive analysis of the recreational and cultural landscape through the lens of trails and festivals. The results can inform regional planning and tourism strategies.
